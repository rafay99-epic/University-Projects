# Introduction:

In this Project we are providing all of the Semester Project for the New User, THe purpose of this Project is the student can view the code and Learn about the code, How to code an application at the beginning Level.

# Project:

In this Repo There are total 5 Projects. 

1. Tick Cross Game 10x10 
2. Chess Game 
3. Music Player Using Data Structure
4. Voting Website.
5. Simulation and Modeling
6. Data Science 

# Project Descriptions

## Project 1: Tick Cross Game:

 In this Project we using C++ Programming Language to develop a Tick Cross Game and the size of the board was 10x10. There are multiple check system and with User input, with a color changing Layout.

## Project 2: Chess Game:

The Chess game was design in C++ using the concepts of object orientated Programming(OOP), we use classes and Inheritance to develop a game for a user, There are two players and each player will get a turn to place their pawn and when the game is over the game will declared a winner.

## Project 3: Music Player Using Data Structure:

In this Project we used different Data Structure to create a Music Player. We used Linked list using pointers to create a list that will create a paylist for the user and will help them to sort there music and also in this application there is a Menu that will help user to create their own Music player.

Using this website we used different components and make a stunning website. The backend is designed in .Net Framework and all of the components can be found in this repo. 

In order to run this repo the user might need to Install Visual Studio with the Support for the Full Web Packages.

## Project 5:  Simulation and Modelling:

In this We designed a Simulation of a Project in Metlab and Code of Metlab  is in the Repo, The Project is the Simulation of a Fish Tank how many fish will live through a threat. In oder to run this project MetLab is needed to installed on the system.
